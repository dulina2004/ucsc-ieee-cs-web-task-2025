## üîß Configuration Required

To activate email functionality, you need to:

1. **Create EmailJS account** (free tier available)
2. **Set up email service** (Gmail recommended)
3. **Create email template** (copy from EMAILJS_SETUP.md)
4. **Add environment variables**:
    ```env
    VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
    VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
    VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
    ```

See `EMAILJS_QUICKSTART.md` for step-by-step instructions.

## üé® Customization Options

### Change Event Details

Edit `src/components/RegistrationForm.tsx` (line ~210):

```typescript
event_name: "Your Event Name",
event_date: "Your Date",
event_location: "Your Location",
```

### Modify Email Design

Edit the HTML template in your EmailJS dashboard to change:

-   Colors and gradients
-   Logo and images
-   Content and messaging
-   Social media links
-   Call-to-action buttons

### Update Email Variables

Add new variables in:

1. `src/lib/emailService.ts` - TypeScript interface
2. EmailJS template - Use `{{variable_name}}`
3. `src/components/RegistrationForm.tsx` - Pass to sendRegistrationEmail()

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Vercel Environment Variables

Add these in Vercel project settings:

-   `VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`
-   `VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`
-   `VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`

### Production Considerations

1. **Email Limits**: Free tier = 200 emails/month

3. **Monitoring**: Check EmailJS dashboard for usage
4. **Upgrade**: Consider paid plan for higher volume
